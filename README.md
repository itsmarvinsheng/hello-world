# hello-world
Hello to my first Github repository
What's up everybody, this is Marvin Sheng. I am currently an Master student of Business Analytics at CUHK Business School. I hope to become an dataa analytics consultant or product manager in the future. Even though these two trajactory seem quite different at the first glance, I think there are quite a few skills interlapped between the two jobs like problem-solving skill, creative-thinking, data analysis, and so on. 
Just for a change.
